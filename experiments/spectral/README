this is the readme for the logistic pca

Here is a Matlab implementation of Logistic Principal Component Analysis 
described in:

 Andrew I. Schein, Lawrence K. Saul and Lyle H. Ungar.
 A Generalized Linear Model for Principal Component Analysis of Binary Data
 To Appear in AI & Statistics 2003.

I created this implementation to check the equations in the paper to be sure 
they were correct before final submission.

The archive contains two versions:

lpca_fitwbias - ALS procedure including a bias term.  This is the version
                described in the paper.

lpca_fit      - ALS procedure without the bias term.

I hope this implementation serves you well.
