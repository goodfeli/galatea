.. _depth_en:

Depth
-----

The computations involved in producing an output from an input can be
represented by a **flow graph**: a flow graph is a graph representing
a computation, in which each node represents an elementary computation
and a value (the result of the computation, applied to the values at the
children of that node). Consider the set of computations allowed in each
node and possible graph structures and this defines a family of
functions. Input nodes have no children. Output nodes have no parents. 

The flow graph for the expression :math:`sin(a^2+b/a)`
could be represented by a graph with two input nodes :math:`a` and :math:`b`,
one node for the division :math:`b/a` taking :math:`a` and :math:`b` as input
(i.e. as children), one node for the square (taking only :math:`a` as input),
one node for the addition (whose value would be :math:`a^2+b/a`) and
taking as input the nodes :math:`a^2` and :math:`b/a`,
and finally one output node computing the sinus, and with a single
input coming from the addition node.

A particular property of such *flow graphs* is **depth**: the length of the
longest path from an input to an output.

Traditional feedforward neural networks can be considered to have depth equal
to the number of layers (i.e. the number of hidden layers plus 1, for the output layer).
Support Vector Machines (SVMs) have depth 2 (one for the kernel outputs or for the
feature space, and one for the linear combination producing the output).

.. _motivations_en:

Motivations for Deep Architectures
----------------------------------

The main motivations for studying learning algorithms for deep architectures are the following:

* `Insufficient depth can hurt`_
* `The brain has a deep architecture`_
* `Cognitive processes seem deep`_
* `Statistical sharing`_

.. _insufficientdepth_en:

Insufficient depth can hurt
---------------------------

Depth 2 is enough in many cases (e.g. logical gates, formal [threshold] neurons,
sigmoid-neurons, Radial Basis Function [RBF] units like in SVMs) to represent
any function with a given target accuracy. But this may come with a price:
that the required number of nodes in the graph (i.e. computations, and
also number of parameters, when we try to learn the function) may
grow very large. Theoretical results showed that there exist function
families for which in fact the required
number of nodes may grow exponentially with the input size.
This has been shown for logical gates, formal neurons, and RBF units.
In the latter case Hastad has shown families of functions which can
be efficiently (compactly) represented with :math:`O(n)` nodes (for :math:`n` inputs)
when depth is :math:`d`, but for which an exponential number (:math:`O(2^n)`)
of nodes is needed if depth is restricted to :math:`d-1`.

One can see a deep architecture as a kind of factorization. Most randomly
chosen functions can't be represented efficiently, whether with a deep or
a shallow architecture. But many that can be represented efficiently with
a deep architecture cannot be represented efficiently with a shallow one
(see the polynomials example in the `Bengio survey paper
<http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Elisa/publications2/index.php/publications/show/239>`_).
The existence of a compact and deep representation indicates that some kind
of structure exists in the underlying function to be represented. If there
was no structure whatsoever, it would not be possible to generalize well.

.. _brain_en:

The brain has a deep architecture
---------------------------------

For example, the visual cortex is well-studied and shows a sequence of areas each of which
contains a representation of the input, and signals flow from one to the next (there are also
skip connections and at some level parallel paths, so the picture is more complex).
Each level of this feature hierarchy represents the input at a different level of abstraction,
with more abstract features further up in the hierarchy, defined in terms of the lower-level ones.

Note that representations in the brain are in between dense distributed and purely local:
they are **sparse**: about 1\% of neurons are active simultaneously in the brain.
Given the huge number of neurons, this is still a very efficient (exponentially efficient)
representation.

.. _cognition_en:

Cognitive processes seem deep
-----------------------------

* Humans organize their ideas and concepts hierarchically.
* Humans first learn simpler concepts and then compose them to represent more abstract ones.
* Engineers break-up solutions into multiple levels of abstraction and processing

It would be nice to learn / discover these concepts 
(knowledge engineering failed because of poor introspection?).
Introspection of linguistically expressible concepts also suggests a *sparse* representation:
only a small fraction of all possible words/concepts are applicable to a particular input
(say a visual scene).

.. _statistical_sharing_en:

Statistical Sharing
-------------------

Intermediate representations can be exploited to *share statistical strength*
across different contexts.
First, if deeper
architectures can be more efficient in terms of number of computational units (to represent
the same function), that in principle means that the number of parameters than need to be
estimated is smaller, which gives rise to greater statistical efficiency.

Another way
to see this is to consider the sharing of statistical strength that occurs when different
components of an architecture are *re-used* for different purposes (e.g., in the computation
for different outputs, or different tasks, or in the computation for different intermediate
features). Since the parameters of a component are used for different purposes, they
share statistical strength among the different examples (or parts of examples) that rely
on these parameters: using more examples, from more contexts, gives more
information on these parameters, allowing to reduce the uncertainty on their
values.

This is similar and related to the sharing of statistical strength
that occurs in distributed representations. For example, if the parameters of
one hidden unit of an RBM are "used" for many examples (because that unit turns
on for many examples), then there is more information available to estimate those
parameters. When a new configuration of the input is presented, it may not correspond
to any of those seen in the training set, but its "components" (possibly represented
at a higher level of abstraction in intermediate representations) may have been seen
previously.

Sharing of statistical strength is a core idea
behind many advances in machine learning. Components and parameters are shared across
tasks in the case of multi-task learning, and deep architectures are particularly
well suited for multi-task learning~(Collobert & Weston, ICML'2008). Similarly semi-supervised
learning exploits statistical sharing between the tasks of learning the 
input distribution P(X) and learning the conditional distribution P(Y|X).
Because deep learning algorithms often rely heavily on unsupervised learning,
they are well suited to exploit this particular form of statistical sharing.

A very related form of sharing occurs in self-taught learning~(Raina et al, 2007),
whereby we consider unlabeled training data from P(X|Y) for a set of classes Y's but really
care about generalizing to tasks P(Y|X) for a different set of Y's. Recent
work showed that deep learners benefit more from the self-taught learning 
and multi-task learning frameworks than shallow learners~(Bengio et al, NIPS 2010 
deep learning workshop).

This is also a form of out-of-domain generalization, for which deep learners are also
well suited, as shown in (Bengio et al, NIPS 2010 deep learning workshop) for pattern recognition
and in (Glorot et al, 2011) for natural language processing (sentiment analysis).

.. _breakthrough_en:

Breakthrough in Learning Deep Architectures
-------------------------------------------

Before 2006, attempts at training deep architectures failed:
training a deep supervised feedforward neural network tends to yield
worse results (both in training and in test error) then shallow ones
(with 1 or 2 hidden layers).

Three papers changed that in 2006, spearheaded by Hinton's revolutionary
work on Deep Belief Networks (DBNs):

* Hinton, G. E., Osindero, S. and Teh, Y.,
  `A fast learning algorithm for deep belief nets <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/%7Ehinton/absps/fastnc.pdf>`_
  Neural Computation 18:1527-1554, 2006

* Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Lamblin, Dan Popovici and Hugo Larochelle,
  `Greedy Layer-Wise Training of Deep Networks <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Elisa/publications2/index.php/publications/show/190>`_,
  in J. Platt et al. (Eds), Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 19 (NIPS 2006), pp. 153-160, MIT Press, 2007

* Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Christopher Poultney, Sumit Chopra and Yann LeCun,
  `Efficient Learning of Sparse Representations with an Energy-Based Model <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/ranzato-06.pdf>`_,
  in J. Platt et al. (Eds), Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2006), MIT Press, 2007

The following key principles are found in all three papers:

* Unsupervised learning of representations is used to (pre-)train each layer.

* Unsupervised training of one layer at a time, on top of the previously trained ones.
  The representation learned at each level is the input for the next layer.

* Use supervised training to fine-tune all the layers (in addition to one or more
  additional layers that are dedicated to producing predictions).

The DBNs use RBMs for unsupervised learning of representation at each layer.
The Bengio et al paper explores and compares RBMs and *auto-encoders* 
(neural network that predicts its input, through a bottleneck internal layer of representation).
The Ranzato et al paper uses sparse auto-encoder (which is similar to *sparse coding*)
in the context of a *convolutional* architecture. Auto-encoders and convolutional
architectures will be covered later in the course.

Since 2006, a plethora of other papers on the subject of deep learning has been published,
some of them exploiting other principles to guide training of intermediate representations.
