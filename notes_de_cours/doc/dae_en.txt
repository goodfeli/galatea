Denoising autoencoders vs. ordinary autoencoders
================================================

A denoising autoencoder is like an ordinary autoencoder, with the difference
that during learning, the input seen by the autoencoder is not the raw input
but a stochastically corrupted version.  A denoising autoencoder is thus
trained to *reconstruct* the original input from the noisy version. For
more information see the article from ICML 2008:
`Denoising Auto-Encoders <http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Elisa/publications2/index.php/publications/show/217>`_.

Principal differences between ordinary autoencoders and denoising
autoencoders:

   * - Aspect
     - Ordinary autoencoders
     - Denoising autoencoders
   * - What it does
     - Finds a compact representation
     - Capture the joint distribution of the inputs
   * - Learning criterion
     - Deterministic
     - Stochastic
   * - Number of hidden units
     - Must be limited to avoid learning the identity function 
     - As many as are necessary for capturing the distribution
   * - How to choose model capacity (i.e. the number of hidden units)
     - Impossible using standard reconstruction error, since it will always be lower with more hidden units
     - Can use the mean reconstruction error
   * - Choosing the number of learning iterations 
     - Impossible using reconstruction error: use classification error after
       supervised fine-tuning
     - Can do early stopping using the mean reconstruction error
   * - Choosing the amount of corrupting noise
     - not applicable
     - Cannot use reconstruction error: use classification error after supervised
       fine-tuning
