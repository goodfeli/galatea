Introduction to Gradient-Based Learning
=======================================

Consider a cost function :math:`C` which maps a parameter vector :math:`\theta`
to a scalar :math:`C(\theta)` which we would like to minimize. In machine
learning the cost function is typically the average or the expectation of
a loss functional:

.. math:: C(\theta) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n L(f_\theta, z_i)

(this is called the *training loss*) or

.. math:: C(\theta) = \int L(f_\theta, z) P(z) dz

(this is called the *generalization loss*), where in supervised
learning we have :math:`z=(x,y)` and :math:`f_\theta(x)`
is a prediction of :math:`y`, indexed by the parameters :math:`theta`.

.. _grad_en:

The Gradient
------------

The gradient of the function :math:`C` of a single scalar :math:`\theta` is formally defined as follows:

.. math::

 \frac{\partial C(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = \lim_{\delta \theta \rightarrow 0}
   \frac{C(\theta + \delta \theta) - C(\theta)}{\delta \theta}

Hence it is the variation :math:`\Delta C` induced by a change :math:`\Delta \theta`,
when :math:`\Delta \theta` is very small.

When :math:`\theta` is a vector, the gradient :math:`\frac{\partial C(\theta)}{\partial \theta}`
is a vector with one element :math:`\frac{\partial C(\theta)}{\partial \theta_i}`
per :math:`\theta_i`, where we consider the other
parameters fixed, we only make the change :math:`\Delta \theta_i` and we measure
the resulting :math:`\Delta C`. When :math:`\Delta \theta_i` is small then
:math:`\frac{\Delta C}{\Delta \theta_i}` becomes :math:`\frac{\partial C(\theta)}{\partial \theta_i}`.

.. _gd_en:

Gradient Descent
----------------

We want to find a :math:`\theta` that minimizes :math:`C(\theta)`.
If we are able to solve 

.. math::
   \frac{\partial C(\theta)}{\partial \theta} = 0

then we can find the minima (and maxima and saddle points), but in general
we are not able to find the solutions of this equation, so we use numerical
optimization methods. Most of these are based on the idea of *local descent*:
iteratively modify :math:`\theta` so as to decrease :math:`C(\theta)`, until
we cannot anymore, i.e., we have arrived at a local minimum (maybe global
if we are lucky).

The simplest of all these gradient-based optimization techniques is
gradient descent. There are many variants of gradient descent, so
we define here *ordinary gradient descent*:

.. math::
    \theta^{k+1} = \theta^k - \epsilon_k    \frac{\partial C(\theta^k)}{\partial \theta^k} 

where :math:`\theta^k` represents our parameters at iteration :math:`k`
and :math:`\epsilon_k` is a scalar that is called the **learning rate**, which
can either be chosen fixed, adaptive or according to a fixed decreasing schedule.

.. _sgd_en:

Stochastic Gradient Descent
---------------------------

We exploit the fact that :math:`C` is an average, generally over i.i.d.
(independently and identically distributed) examples, to make updates to :math:`\theta`
much more often, in the extreme (and most common) case after each example:

.. math::
    \theta^{k+1} = \theta^k - \epsilon_k    \frac{\partial L(\theta^k,z)}{\partial \theta^k} 

where :math:`z` is the next example from the training set, or the next example
sampled from the training distribution, in the **online** setting (where we have not
a fixed-size training set but instead access to a stream of examples from
the data generating process). Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a more
general principle in which the update direction is a random variable
whose expectations is the true gradient of interest. The convergence
conditions of SGD are similar to those for gradient descent, in spite
of the added randomness.

SGD can be **much faster** than ordinary (also called batch) gradient descent,
because it makes updates much more often. This is especially true for large
datasets, or in the online setting. In fact, in machine learning tasks,
one only uses ordinary gradient descent instead of SGD when the function
to minimize cannot be decomposed as above (as a mean).

.. _minibatch_en:

Minibatch Stochastic Gradient Descent
-------------------------------------

This is a minor variation on SGD in which we obtain the update direction by
taking the average over a small batch (minibatch) of :math:`B` examples (e.g. 10, 20 or 100).
The main advantage is that instead of doing :math:`B` Vector x Matrix products 
one can often do a Matrix x Matrix product where the first matrix has :math:`B` rows,
and the latter can be implemented more efficiently (sometimes 2 to 10 times faster,
depending on the sizes of the matrices). 

Minibatch SGD has the advantage that it works with a slightly less noisy
estimate of the gradient (more so as :math:`B` increases). However, as
the minibatch size increases, the number of updates done per computation
done decreases (eventually it becomes very inefficient, like batch gradient
descent). There is an optimal trade-off (in terms of computational efficiency)
that may vary depending on the data distribution and the particulars of
the class of function considered, as well as how computations are implemented
(e.g. parallelism can make a difference).

.. _momentum_en:

Momentum
--------

Another variation that is similar in spirit to minibatch SGD is the use of
so-called momentum: the idea is to compute on-the-fly (online) a moving
average of the past gradients, and use this moving average instead of
the current example's gradient, in the update equation.
The moving average is typically an exponentially decaying moving
average, i.e.,

.. math::
 \Delta \theta^{k+1} = \alpha \Delta \theta^k + (1-\alpha) \frac{\partial L(\theta^k,z)}{\partial \theta^k}

where :math:`\alpha` is a hyper-parameter that controls how much
weight is given in this average to older vs most recent gradients.

.. _lrate_en:

Choosing the Learning Rate Schedule
-----------------------------------

If the step size is too large -- larger than twice the largest eigenvalue of the
second derivative matrix (Hessian) of :math:`C` --, then gradient steps will go upward
instead of downward. If the step size is too small, then convergence is slower.

The most common choices of learning rate schedule (:math:`\epsilon_k`) are the following:

* constant schedule, :math:`\epsilon_k = \epsilon_0`: this is the most common choice. 
  It in theory gives an exponentially larger 
  weight to recent examples, and is particularly appropriate in a non-stationary
  environment, where the distribution may change. It is very robust but
  error will stop improving after a while, where a smaller learning rate could
  yield a more precise solution (approaching the minimum a bit more).

* :math:`1/k` schedule: :math:`\epsilon_k = \epsilon_0 \frac{\tau}{\tau + k}`.

  This schedule is guaranteed to reach asymptotic convergence (as :math:`k \rightarrow \infty`)
  because it satisfies the following requirements:

  .. math:: \sum_{k=1}^\infty \epsilon_k = \infty

  .. math:: \sum_{k=1}^\infty \epsilon_k^2 < \infty

  and this is true for any :math:`\tau` but :math:`\epsilon_0` must be small enough
  to avoid divergence, where the error rises instead of decreasing.

  A disadvantage is that an additional hyper-parameter :math:`\tau` is introduced.
  Another is that in spite of its guarantees, a poor choice of :math:`\tau` can
  yield very slow convergence.

Flow Graphs, Chain Rule and Backpropagation: Efficient Computation of the Gradient
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider a function (in our case it is :math:`L(\theta,z)`) of several arguments,
and we wish to compute it as well as its derivative (gradient) w.r.t. some of its
arguments. We will decompose the computation of the function in terms of
elementary computations for which partial derivatives are easy to compute,
forming a *flow graph* (as already discussed :ref:`there <depth_en>`).
A flow graph is an acyclic graph where each node represents the result
of a computation that is performed using the values associated with
connected nodes of the graph. It has input nodes (with no predecessors)
and output nodes (with no successors).

Each node of the flow graph is associated with a symbolic expression
that defines how its value is computed in terms of the values of its children
(the nodes from which it takes its input). We will focus on flow graphs
for the purpose of efficiently computing gradients, so we will keep track
of gradients with respect to a special output node (denoted :math:`L`
here to refer to a loss to be differentiated with respect to parameters,
in our case). We will associate with  each node 

 * the node value
 * the symbolic expression that specifies how to compute the node value in terms
   of the value of its predecessors (children)
 * the partial derivative of :math:`L` with respect to the node value
 * the symbolic expressions that specify to how compute the partial derivative
   of each node value with respect to the values of its predecessors.

Let :math:`L` be the output scalar node of the flow graph, and consider
an arbitrary node :math:`u` whose parents (the nodes taking the value
computed at :math:`u` as input) are :math:`v_i`.
In addition to the value :math:`u` (abuse of notation) associated
with node :math:`u`, we will also associate with each node :math:`u`
a partial derivative :math:`\frac{\partial L}{\partial u}`.

The **chain rule for derivatives** specifies how the partial
derivative :math:`\frac{\partial L}{\partial u}` for a node :math:`u`
can be obtained **recursively** from the partial derivatives :math:`\frac{\partial L}{\partial v_i}`
for its parents :math:`v_i`:

.. math::
  \frac{\partial L}{\partial u} = \sum_i \frac{\partial L}{\partial v_i} \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial u}

Note that :math:`\frac{\partial L}{\partial L} = 1` which starts the recursion at the
root node of the graph (node that in general it is a graph, not a tree, because there
may be multiple paths from a given node to the root -- output -- node).
Note also that each :math:`\frac{\partial v_i}{\partial u}` is an expression (and a corresponding
value, when the inputs are given) that is associated with an *arc* of the graph
(and each arc is associated with one such partial derivative).

Note how the gradient computations involved in this recipe *go exactly in the
opposite direction* compared to those required to compute :math:`L`.
In fact we say that gradients are **back-propagated**, following the
arcs *backwards*. The instantiation of this procedure for computing
gradients in the case of feedforward multi-layer neural networks
is called the :ref:`**back-propagation algorithm** <backprop_en>`.

In the example already shown :ref:`earlier <depth_en>`, 
:math:`L=sin(a^2+b/a)` and there are two paths from :math:`a` to :math:`L`.

This recipe gives us the following nice guarantee. If the computation of :math:`L`
is expressed with :math:`n` computations expressed through :math:`n` nodes
(and each node computation requires a constant computation time)
and :math:`m` arcs, then
computing all the partial derivatives  :math:`\frac{\partial L}{\partial u}`
requires (at most) :math:`O(m)` computations, using the above recursion
(in general, with a bounded in-degree, this is also :math:`O(n)`).
Furthermore, this is a lower bound, i.e., it is not possible to 
compute the gradients faster (up to an additive and multiplicative constant).

Note that there are many ways in which to compute these gradients, and
whereas the above algorithm is the fastest one, it is easy to write
down an apparently simple recursion that would instead be exponentially
slower, e.g., in :math:`O(2^n)`. In general 
:math:`\frac{\partial L}{\partial u}` can be written as 
a sum over all paths in the graph from :math:`u` to :math:`L`
of the products of the partial derivatives along each path.

An illustration of this is with a graph with the following structure: 

.. math::
   x_t = f(x_{t-1}, y_{t-1})

   y_t = g(x_{t-1}, y_{t-1})

where there are :math:`p = n/2` such :math:`(x_t,y_t)` pairs of node, ending with 
:math:`L=h(x_p,y_p)` and with input nodes :math:`x_0` and :math:`y_0`.
The number of paths from :math:`x_0` to :math:`L` is
:math:`2^p = 2^{n/2} = (\sqrt{2})^n``.
Note by mental construction how the number of paths doubles as we
increase :math:`p` by 1.
